# Machine Learning to detect Hacking
This repository includes the feature extraction from a database of **Hacking Attacks** using a Honeypot. The features are:
| Parameters   | Type |
| -------- | ------- |
| Tool Attack  | Categorical or class  |
| IP address | Integer   |
| Country  | Categorical or class    |
| Time | Integer    |

The process is summarized as a Multiple Linear Regression with an output of probability for the Type of Attack as shown in the next table:
| Types of Attack    |
| -------- |
| BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS   | 
|  COMMAND INJECTION   |   
| CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)  |  
|  DDOS ATTACK     |   
|  DEFACEMENT |       
| SQL INJECTION |        
| THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE| 

## Authomatic Control System
* To inject the substance, this software includes an authomatic algorithm to process a image which is save in a interval of time during the experiment.
* **Perccentage of Area** is the parameter that algorithm computes by image to take a decision to inject high or low flow of fluid.

This is a test version 0.2.1
